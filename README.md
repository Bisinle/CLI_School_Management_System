## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```python
git clonehttps://github.com/Bisinle/CLI_School_Management_System
```

### 2. Navigate to the project's directory

```python
cd CLI_School_Management_System
```

### 3. Install required dependencies

The root directory of this repository contains the `Pipfile` with all the required dependencies. To install them into your virtual environment, run this command from the `root` directory:

```python
pipenv install
```

If `pipenv` is not already installed, you can do so using `pip`:

```python
pip install pipenv
```

### 4. Activate the virtual environment

```python
pipenv shell
```

### 4. Run `main.py` for testing

```
python main.py
```

## Entity Relationship

<img src='../PROJECT/project_image/ERD.png' width='300' >

#### Student Class:

The Student class represents the "students" table in your database.
It has a one-to-many relationship with the "grades" table. This means that each student can have multiple grades associated with them, typically from different courses.

#### Teacher Class:

The Teacher class corresponds to the "teachers" table in the database.
There's no direct relationship defined in this class, but it's implied that teachers may be associated with courses through the "courses" table.

#### Course Class:

The Course class represents the "courses" table.
It has a many-to-one relationship with the "teacher" table. This implies that multiple courses can be taught by a single teacher.
It also has a many-to-many relationship with the "student" table. This suggests that multiple students can enroll in the same course, and a student can be enrolled in multiple courses.

#### Grade Class:

The Grade class corresponds to the "grades" table in your database.
It has a one-to-many relationship with the "students" table, meaning each grade entry is associated with a single student.
It also has a one-to-many relationship with the "courses" table, indicating that each grade entry is related to a specific cours
